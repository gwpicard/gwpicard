			<h2>About</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Hi 👋🏽 My name is Guillaume (William), I'm a data scientist by training with many diverging (and converging) interests. I was part of the first graduating class at the <a href="https://www.minerva.edu/" target="_blank">Minerva Schools at KGI</a>, a fairly offbeat experimental university. Before transferring to Minerva, I also briefly studied Aero-mechanical Engineering.</p>
		<p> In the last few years, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers in the medical sciences and applied physics in labs across 3 continents, worked at a <a href="http://kano.me/" target="_blank">creative computer startup</a> on logistics and user research, helped grow data science at an energy company (one of the <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/bulb-fastest-growing-startup-uk-renewable-energy-expansion/" target="_blank">UK's fastest-growing startups</a>), and built computer simulation models at Apple.</p>
