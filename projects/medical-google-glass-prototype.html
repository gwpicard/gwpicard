<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a research project I worked on while working at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Scotland, UK in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The goal was to design a portable device with a live-video feed that would allow a junior surgeon/trainee to monitor a surgery from the senior surgeon's point of view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Early versions of the research prototype involved development using a repurposed CMOS camera module, then moving onto a Raspberry Pi/webcam interface, and finally modifying an extreme sports camera circuitboard.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype: V1</strong><br />
