# (Not) the only advice you'll ever need

> "Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong."&mdash;Oscar Wilde

<p style="text-align: center;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

Whenever a doubt pops into my mind, I'm always keen to hunt for answers. Fortunately, from "[how to pick a career](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)" to "[secrets to a successful relationship](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rediscovering-love/201511/14-secrets-great-relationship)", there is advice out there on [almost every conceivable topic](https://www.quora.com/): I read Wait But Why for quirky insights into [life's big questions](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/09/marriage-decision.html); I consult Brain Pickings for [fresh takes on ancient wisdom](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/03/advice-on-writing/); and of course, endless browsing of [blog posts](https://angel.co/blog/naval-ravikants-guide-to-choosing-your-first-job-in-tech), [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D73mm29XXAw), and [podcasts](https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/). The issue with this ever-growing body of insightful reflections and practical recommendations is that it's becoming harder to distinguish between good and bad advice.

Sometimes I wish someone could tell me exactly what I need to know but what makes for the best advice depends on the situation&mdash;"listen to what the heart says" is almost always a better recommendation to give a 15-year-old afraid to declare their love than a cardiologist looking for a second opinion. However, not knowing what's "best" shouldn't push us to accept any advice; I want to share some of the tools that have helped me identify the good advice from the noise.

## Asking questions

We usually think about advice in terms of what people tell us; we should also consider the importance of what we ask and how that affects the quality of the advice we receive.

**Understanding the power of questions**

The questions we ask will define the advice we receive. Asking "Where do you see yourself in five years?" presupposes that you should be planning for your future. Asking "Should I take this job?" naturally excludes the possibility of considering other opportunities.

It's important to recognise that what you ask can frame the advice you will receive.

**Asking good questions**

Good questions are powerful thinking tools. Imagine you are thinking through whether to quit your job: "Will this job make me successful in my career?" will lead to a different kind of advice than "Would I still be doing this job if I wasn't getting paid?" &mdash;the preferred question depends on what you value more (in this case, your career or your time). Author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss is [particularly skilled at asking good questions](https://tim.blog/2016/12/07/testing-the-impossible-17-questions-that-changed-my-life/) and uses them to focus on what's essential and make decisions. For example, when dealing with stressful situations, he asks "What would this look like if it were easy?" to simplify his thinking.

Good questions can keep you aligned with your values and help you think more creatively.

## Getting answers

Anyone we ask can give us advice, and the advice we get can be immensely influential in the decisions we make. Here are some approaches to help tell good advice from the noise.

**The expert approach: Who is wise is not always right**

Figures of authority can have tremendous weight over what we believe to be true, and it's worth examining whether we should always trust their advice. Consider these examples:

- A mathematics professor is unable to [explain a concept in calculus in a simple way](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-to-break-the-experts-curse)
- A professional musician underestimates how difficult it is to learn harmony
- An experienced investor doesn't think a [novel business idea is valuable](https://hbr.org/2017/12/too-many-experts-can-hurt-your-innovation-projects)
- A (twice-divorced) renowned climate scientist is asked to give love advice

Decoding expert advice is a tricky subject&mdash;you probably shouldn't trust a baker to estimate the risk of nuclear war. However, being an expert in one area doesn't automatically make you trustworthy on every topic; neither does it mean that you can relate to what it's like to be a non-expert.

Consider a person's field of expertise, how it affects the recommendations they give you, and whether they are uniquely qualified to provide you with [advice on a specific topic](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1998644,00.html).

**The cognitive approach: We're biased**

If your parents repeatedly told you as a kid that "artists never make any money", you might have grown up believing that life as an artist is impossible. Even if someone has a great deal of life experience, they may have internalised particular conceptions of the world&mdash;whatever fears and assumptions they hold about "how the world works" are implicit in the advice they share with others.

The mindset, experiences, and narratives of people around you [bias the advice they give](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) which can limit how you see the world.

**The relationship approach: When friends agree with you**

I'm talking to my friend about how someone ignored me and how that made me feel like I did something wrong&mdash;all the while my friend agrees with my interpretation of the event. It's nice to have my point of view acknowledged, but it's possible that the reason why that person was ignoring me had nothing to do with me. By agreeing and not challenging my reasoning, the advice I get from my friend reinforces my limited point of view rather than provide a different angle.

If you only surround yourself with [people who agree with you](https://fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/), you will never get advice from the diverse perspectives of those who challenge you.

**The statistical approach: The exception or the rule?**

Privilege, luck, and connections all play a role in determining someone's success. When a college dropout tells you the best thing to do is to drop out of college and start a business, did she have a fallback? If a successful artist tells you to "follow your dreams," why did other artists fail?

Individual perspectives aren't always representative of the bigger picture; sometimes success stories can be [exceptions to the rule](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). Understanding what factors play into people's stories and seeking out representative viewpoints enable us to get a sense of the overall trends.

**The cultural approach: What is popular is loud**

"Work hard," "Say 'Yes' to everything," "Do what you love"... we've all heard these sayings before. The problem with popular advice is that it tends to be vague and [disseminated even when it's false](https://www.cracked.com/blog/9-common-pieces-life-advice-that-are-bad-stupid/).

Push people to be specific and concrete: "What does saying 'Yes' to everything mean? Can you give me examples?"&mdash;you could otherwise risk walking away with a misguided sense of clarity.

**The emotional approach: The "gut feeling"**

There are times when no one agrees with us, and all we need is for one person to support us to feel confident about a decision. When everyone around you tells you to give up on what you think is a great novel to write or a valuable invention, your gut can be a [useful signal for what to do](http://emocoglab.depaul.edu/publications/journals/Mikels_Maglio_Reed_&Kaplowitz_2011.pdf).

Listen to your intuition, and if you feel reassured when someone you trust agrees with you, it's [probably the right direction](https://www.philosophytalk.org/shows/gut-feelings).


## Why should I trust your advice?

Advice is everywhere, and it's tempting to want to listen to it all. If this article should persuade you of anything, ironically, it's to be critical of all advice&mdash;including the advice from this piece. You can use the tools above to help you be more critical when asking for and receiving advice. Whatever you do with these suggestions, it certainly won't be the only advice you'll ever need.
