The above message is probably a fair representation of a person's typical experience with customer service - a kind of impersonal, non-committing passive aggressive cordial tone with a pinch of hope and a ray of consideration.

As a customer care agent, I replied to customer queries on a daily basis. With time, I came to understand some of the deeper problems associated with crafting of a "good" customer message. I had to adopt the company's voice and communicate our ethos, all the while trying to remove my personal opinion from the equation (this is especially difficult to do in situations where I disagree with the standard course of action).

The vagueness of customer service language is tied to the legal complications that business communication entails. If I tell you that I will complete a task by tomorrow and then fail to do so, you will inevitably gain a position of leverage whereby the record of my promise becomes a well-evidenced inability to deliver - a mistake that could cost handsomely in the courtroom. It's safer not to take any chances. This dialogue then quickly degrades into bastardised vernacular masked behind a coat of well-mannered formality, also known as the "we're-terribly-sorry-about-the-mistake-but-we-are-unable-to-give-you-more-information-at-the-moment."

My job made me question what the true purpose of customer service--as much as I had always disliked interacting with customer service agents in the past, here I was replicating the very behaviour I despised. The reality is two-fold - customer expectations and company fears. Customers sometimes forget than humans make mistakes and that there is always an inevitable cost to doing business.  and companies conveniently assume that customers don't expect much from them while making sure that systems .

The art of customer service is honesty and openness. Customers are also people who can empathise, as long as the communication is respectful and friendly as when you would talk to an uncle or aunt. Legalese is a great way to get customers to stop asking questions, but it doesn't grow customer trust and satisfaction.

I hope you enjoyed reading this post, have a great day!
