<p style="text-align:justify;">Project Pico was a student engineering project led by Guillaume Picard and Gautam Rai from the Mahindra United World College of India.  The idea was to build a fully functional go-kart exclusively from repurposed materials, and the kart was completed in its most basic form in May 2012.</p>
<p>The project was fully funded by the science department in the college.</p>
